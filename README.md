# ML Stock Prediction Dashboard
• Predicting future stock prices of Microsoft (MSFT) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and visualizing the data using a Streamlit dashboard application

# Phase 1: EDA + Data cleaning
• Analyzed and classified stocks based on riskiness through calculating financial indicators metrics such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), and volatility. This analysis allowed insights in understand historical trends, price momentum, and potential overbought or oversold conditions.  
• Cleaned the data to identify outliers by calculating Interquartile Range (IQR) and Standard Deviation (SD) to pinpoint key events like market crashes and stock splits.


# Phase 2: Deep Learning using LSTM & Sentiment Analysis
• Employ Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN and linear regression to predict stock prices, evaluating the predictive power and limitations of each model before integrating them for enhanced accuracy.


# Phase 3: Data Visualizations on Dashboard using Streamlit
• Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for visualizing stock prices and predictions, using Streamlit ML functions and LSTM prediction.
